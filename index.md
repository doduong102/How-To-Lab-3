# Grep Time

grep is a unix command that allows us to filter through files given a "keyword" or pattern that we're looking for. Here is the syntax for how we use grep:

`grep [string goes here with parenthesis] pattern [file name goes here no paranthesis]`

Some options on the menu:

A) `grep -v` : Prints all lines that do not match pattern

B) `grep -c` : Prints line count that matches the pattern

C) `grep -n` : Displays the matched lines and their line numbers.

D) `grep -i` : Prints matched lines, contents only

## PART A

What `grep -v` is doing in these examples is basically taking our string, file, and returning all the lines and words that do not match out string. The strings I chose did not appear very often relative to the rest of the file so it's quite a mess.

## PART B

`grep -c` is simpler and will just print the number of lines that the string appears in.


## PART C

`grep -n` I can see personally be quite useful to use on something like a comment section or chat history. What this version of `grep` does in particular is prints every line that matches the pattern and line number than it appears on



## PART D

`grep -i` is similar to n but instead it drops the number line count.

And that's grep!
